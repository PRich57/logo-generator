# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

  - As a web developer, I want to generate a logo for my projects so I don't have to pay a graphic designer
  - I built this project to have logos quickly generated for projects so more time can be allocated to the project itself
  - This project solves the problem of spending money or time for logo generation
  - This project helped me get a better grasp on using inquirer as well as unit testing and class inheritance
  - In the future I will add additional shapes to give access to more creative designs
